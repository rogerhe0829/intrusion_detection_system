I decided to restart this project by using MySQL for the data relevant tasks. I created a table in MySQL and I learned to map the column names and the datatype for each column in to
the table for a more convenient future use. All the work was down in the make_sql_table.py script. I practiced using pandas library by using built in functions to iterate each row
of the feature csv to obtain the Name and the Type. Testing ran successfully.

I also made a deepcopy of the orignal UNSW-NB15_1.csv DataFrame for future data cleaning process. Data cleaning process is started.
