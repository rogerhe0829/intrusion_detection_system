"""1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing
Requirements:

Dataset Familiarity:
Understand the structure of the UNSW-NB15 dataset (features, labels, types of attacks).     (Complete)
Analyze the key features: srcip, sport, dstip, dsport, proto, state, service, etc.          (IPR)

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values and inconsistencies (e.g., NULL values, non-numeric values).
Normalize or standardize numerical data (to ensure consistent scales across features).
Feature Selection:
Identify which features are relevant for detecting intrusions (use domain knowledge or techniques like feature importance ranking).
Tools:

Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.
2. Data Splitting and Labeling
Requirements:

Train-Test Split:
Divide the dataset into training and test sets (common split is 70% training, 30% testing).
Label Encoding:
Ensure that attack types or statuses (e.g., normal traffic vs. attack) are correctly labeled.
Use label encoding or one-hot encoding if necessary for categorical variables.
Tools:

Python libraries: scikit-learn (for train_test_split), LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder.
3. Feature Engineering
Requirements:

Transformation of Categorical Features:
Encode categorical variables like protocol types, services, and states.
Create New Features:
You may create additional features based on existing ones, such as ratios or flags that could help in detecting anomalies.
Dimensionality Reduction (Optional):
Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE to reduce the feature space, which can improve model performance.
Tools:

Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, PCA.
4. Model Building
Requirements:

Select Machine Learning Algorithms:
Try a variety of classifiers suited for IDS, such as:
Decision Trees/Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Use techniques like grid search or random search to fine-tune model parameters for better performance.
Tools:

Python libraries: scikit-learn (for traditional machine learning models), tensorflow or keras (for neural networks).
5. Evaluation
Requirements:

Performance Metrics:
Evaluate your model using common metrics for classification problems, such as:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
AUC-ROC curve (useful for binary classification: intrusion vs. no intrusion).
Cross-Validation:
Perform k-fold cross-validation to ensure that your model generalizes well and is not overfitting to the training data.
Tools:

Python libraries: scikit-learn (for metrics and cross-validation).
6. Handling Imbalanced Data
Requirements:

Data Resampling Techniques:
Since intrusion detection datasets tend to be imbalanced (more normal traffic than attacks), consider using:
Oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) for the minority class.
Undersampling for the majority class.
Class weight adjustment during model training to penalize misclassification of the minority class.
Tools:

Python libraries: imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn (for handling imbalanced datasets).
7. Model Deployment (Optional)
Requirements:

Real-Time Detection:
If you're planning to deploy this IDS in a real-time environment, you’ll need to integrate the model into a pipeline that processes live network traffic.
Model Serialization:
Use tools like Pickle or ONNX to serialize and save the trained model so it can be deployed for real-time predictions.
Tools:

Python libraries: pickle, joblib (for saving models), flask or FastAPI (for serving the model as an API).
8. Visualization and Reporting
Requirements:

Data Visualization:
Create visualizations for understanding the traffic patterns, including:
Traffic flow between different IPs.
Histogram or heatmaps of attacks over time.
Confusion matrix to show classification performance.
Dashboards:
Consider creating a simple dashboard to monitor the model’s performance and network activity.
Tools:

Python libraries: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dash.
9. Improvement and Continuous Learning (Optional)
Requirements:

Anomaly Detection:
If the IDS should detect unknown attacks (not just those in the dataset), you could consider using unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering techniques) or anomaly detection algorithms.
Continuous Learning:
Implement techniques that allow the model to learn from new data (online learning), especially if the network environment is dynamic.
10. Documentation
Requirements:

Write Documentation:
Provide clear documentation on how your IDS was built, its architecture, how to train the model, and how to deploy it in a real-world environment.
Explain Attack Types:
Document how the IDS classifies different types of attacks and which features were important for identifying them.
Additional Add-ons:
Threat Intelligence:
Incorporate external threat intelligence (e.g., IP blacklists, reputation services) to enhance detection accuracy.
Signature-based Detection (Optional):
In addition to machine learning models, you could add signature-based detection rules (similar to tools like Snort)."""
